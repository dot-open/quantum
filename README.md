# Quantum - A simple downloader

This project was inspired by [Leo's](https://github.com/LeoLezury) download manager prototype, I changed the UI and made it a dotStudio project.

**Still in development, some features may be unstable.**

## Download

Get the latest binaries from [Releases Page](https://github.com/dot-open/quantum/releases).

Releases will be ready when it's stable, clone this repo and build if you want to try it :)

## What and Why

Quantum is a simple downloader written in C#.

It supports multi-threaded download, which can make the download time much shorter than the browser.

We started this project because the download speed of the browser was super slow. I know there are many download managers that support multi-threading, but what I wanted was to integrate plugins to ensure other download needs.

## Features

Adding, deleting, pausing, resuming and saving download tasks, customizing thread count and user agent.

More Features can be brought to quantum by installing plugins.
